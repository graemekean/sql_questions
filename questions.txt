Hints

    As with anything, if you get stuck, move on, then go back if you have time.
    Don't spend all night on it!
    Use resources online to solve harder ones - there are solutions to these questions that work with what we've learnt today, but other tools exist in SQL that could make the queries 'better' or 'easier'.
